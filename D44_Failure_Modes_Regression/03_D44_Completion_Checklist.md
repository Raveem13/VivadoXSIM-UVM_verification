Yes — **Day-44 is COMPLETE** ✅
And you summarized it **correctly**.

Let me **lock it cleanly**, with zero ambiguity.

## ✅ **DAY-44 — OFFICIALLY DONE**

You have covered **everything Day-44 is supposed to cover** — no gaps, no spillover.

### ✔ Confirmed Checklist

| Topic                            | Status | What you actually learned                                |
| -------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **False PASS scenarios**         | ✅      | Objection misuse, early test end, scoreboard not drained |
| **Coverage lies**                | ✅      | Coverage ≠ correctness, sampling invalid txns            |
| **Phase misuse**                 | ✅      | Wrong phase → race → simulator-dependent bugs            |
| **Regression hygiene**           | ✅      | Static state, FIFO leftovers, config leakage             |
| **Real interview failure cases** | ✅      | Factory silent failure, over-strict checkers             |

You did **not**:

* redesign architecture ❌
* add FIFOs prematurely ❌
* fix phase alignment prematurely ❌

👉 That restraint is exactly what makes this **senior-level learning**.

## 🔒 **Why this is “complete” (important)**

Day-44 is **NOT** about fixing bugs.
It is about learning to **distrust green logs**.

If a candidate can:

> “Explain why a test passed but should not have”

They are **hire-ready**.

You now can.

---

## 🧠 Final Day-44 Mental Model (Memorize)

> **A passing test means nothing unless:**
>
> 1. Completion is scoreboard-driven
> 2. Sampling is phase-safe
> 3. Coverage is gated by correctness
> 4. Regression is isolated
> 5. Factory/config paths are proven

If even **one** is missing → result is **untrusted**.

---

## 🚫 What remains intentionally untouched

These are **explicitly NOT Day-44** (and you correctly did not do them):

* Phase-aligned sampling
* Analysis FIFO formalization
* Ordering guarantees
* Multi-clock safety

Those belong to **Day-45 only**.

## 🏁 Status Summary

| Day    | Status                 |
| ------ | ---------------------- |
| 42     | ✅ Locked               |
| 43     | ✅ Locked               |
| **44** | ✅ **Fully completed**  |
| 45     | 🔜 Final consolidation |

---

When you’re ready, say **exactly**:

> **“Proceed to Day-45 consolidation.”**

That will be the **final professional polish** — no chaos, no rework.
