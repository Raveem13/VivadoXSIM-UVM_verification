Good question — this is exactly the **right pause point** before UVM.
Let me answer **cleanly and decisively**, no ambiguity.

---

## ✅ First: What is actually LEFT before UVM?

Very little — and it’s **conceptual + interview-oriented**, not more coding.

### 🔹 Left before UVM (FINAL non-UVM items)

This is what I earlier called **“Day-13 – Final DV Day”**:

### 🟦 Day-13 (FINAL – wrap-up, no new TB concepts)

**Interview-grade readiness**

1. **Explain your testbench in 5 minutes**

   * DUT
   * Interface
   * Driver
   * Monitor
   * Scoreboard
   * Coverage
   * Assertions
     (This is CRITICAL for interviews)

2. **Common DV interview traps**

   * “Coverage is 100%, is verification complete?” ❌
   * “Assertion passed, so DUT is correct” ❌
   * “Monitor should drive signals” ❌

3. **Assertion vs Coverage vs Scoreboard**

   * Who detects what
   * Who you trust in which scenario

4. **What NOT to say in interviews**

   * Overclaiming
   * Tool-dependent answers
   * “I followed a tutorial”

5. **Resume alignment**

   * How to describe your Day-9 to Day-12 work as:

     > “Built constrained-random SV testbench with functional coverage, assertions, scoreboard”

👉 **This is the LAST non-UVM day.**
No new syntax. No new features.

## 🔜 What I need from you

Reply with **ONE** of these (your choice):

* **“Proceed Day-13”** → we finish everything left before UVM
* **“Create UVM roadmap + directory checklist”** → quick setup guide
* **“Start UVM Day-1 now”** → if you want to jump straight in

You’re doing fine. Stay focused — you’re exactly where a strong DV candidate should be.
