In digital electronics, a race condition (or hazard) happens in asynchronous circuits when multiple state variables change due to one input change, 
and their different arrival times (delays) cause them to transition in an unexpected order, leading to temporary, incorrect intermediate states or 
even different final stable states, making the circuit's behavior timing-dependent and unreliable. It's a "race" for signals to settle, and if the 
outcome isn't identical regardless of the slight timing differences, it's a critical race that must be avoided through design, like proper clocking 
or synchronization. 

How it happens (Asynchronous Circuits)
Multiple Changes: An input change makes several internal state variables (like flip-flop outputs) try to change simultaneously.
Unequal Delays: Due to transistor variations or path lengths, these signals don't arrive at their destinations at exactly the same instant.
Unexpected Path: Instead of going directly from state A to state C (e.g., 00 to 11), the circuit might briefly go through state B (e.g., 00 -> 10 -> 11 or 00 -> 01 -> 11), depending on which signal "wins" the race. 

How to Avoid
Synchronous Design: Use clocked sequential circuits (like master-slave flip-flops) to ensure state changes happen only on a precise clock edge, not randomly.
Clock Gating: Safely inhibit clocks in the middle of their low period to prevent glitches.
Synchronization: Use synchronizers (like two flip-flops) to handle asynchronous inputs reliably.
