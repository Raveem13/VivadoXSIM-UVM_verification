Wire Vs Reg Vs logic

In Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) like Verilog/SystemVerilog, 
wire connects components (physical wires, combinational logic), 
reg stores values (flip-flops, latches, registers), 
and logic (SystemVerilog) is a versatile, unified type that acts like wire or reg depending on assignment context, representing both connections and storage, simplifying design by avoiding confusion and allowing multi-driver assignment with "last-assignment-wins" behavior.
