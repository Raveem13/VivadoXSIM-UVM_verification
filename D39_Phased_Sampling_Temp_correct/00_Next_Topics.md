Understood. Here is the **clean, corrected plan with ONLY non-covered topics**, in **strict logical order**, **no merges**, **no repeats**.

---

## ✅ Already covered (will NOT appear again)

* Day-36: End-of-test, objections, drain time ✔
* Day-37: Monitor → analysis_port → scoreboard/coverage ✔
* Day-38: Check vs Scoreboard vs Coverage ✔
* Day-39 (most): Coverage structure, bins, cross, HTML reports ✔

---

## 🔴 NOT yet fully covered (only these remain)

### **Day-39 (Finalize — small but important)**

**Phase-Aligned & Valid Sampling**

* Gate coverage sampling on protocol-valid condition
* Prevent double counting
* Define *when* a transaction is legally coverable

👉 This is a **refinement**, not a new concept.

---

### **Day-40 — Virtual Sequences & Policy Control**

**WHO controls stimulus**

* Virtual sequencer role
* Coordinating multiple agents
* Policy-based stimulus ordering
* Why sequences should not “know” topology

---

### **Day-41 — Config DB (Configuration as Architecture)**

**HOW behavior is configured**

* set/get paths
* Passing knobs without coupling
* env ↔ agent ↔ component control
* Real mistakes & debugging config_db

---

### **Day-42 — Factory (Replacement & Scalability)**

**HOW components are swapped**

* Factory vs new()
* Type vs instance overrides
* Why factory matters only at scale
* Debugging factory mistakes

---

### **Day-43 — Debugging, Failure Modes & Regression Mindset**

**WHY real projects fail**
    
* Coverage lies
* Scoreboard false passes
* Phase misuse
* Regression hygiene
* Interview-level failure scenarios

---

## 🧮 Final count

* **Day-39 (short close)**
* **Day-40**
* **Day-41**
* **Day-42**
* **Day-43**

👉 **Exactly 5 days left.**
No merging. No skipping. No re-teaching.

If you want, next response I’ll **close Day-39 in one tight message** and then move forward cleanly.
