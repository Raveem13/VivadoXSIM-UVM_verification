Excellent catch 👍 — and you’re right to call this out.
Let’s **clean this up properly** so there’s **zero ambiguity** going forward.

---

## 🔥 What actually happened (honest clarification)

I used **two different labels** for *two closely related but different goals*, both under the umbrella of “what comes after Factory”.

That caused confusion. This is the **correct, final structure** 👇

---

## ✅ **Correct & Locked Ordering (Post Day-42)**

### **Day-43 — Factory × Config DB (Real-World Patterns)**

**WHY factories alone are not enough**

This is a **bridge day** between *mechanics* and *debug mindset*.

**Focus**

* Factory decides **WHAT class**
* Config DB decides **HOW that class behaves**
* How real projects combine both

**Topics**

* Factory for structural swaps (driver/monitor/agent)
* Config DB for behavior knobs
* Factory + config working together
* Anti-patterns:

  * Using factory for behavior
  * Using config for topology
* Real industry examples:

  * RTL vs gate-level
  * VIP normal vs faulty mode
  * Silicon bug workarounds

📌 **Hands-on**:
One small extension to your Day-42 test (no new env)

---

### **Day-44 — Debugging, Failure Modes & Regression Mindset**

**WHY real projects fail**

This is where interviews are won or lost.

**Focus**

* False passes
* Phase misuse
* Coverage lies
* Regression hygiene
* Factory/config misuse failures

📌 No new architecture — only **breaking and diagnosing**.

---

## ❌ What is NOT happening

* ❌ No second “Day-35”
* ❌ No re-teaching FIFOs or sampling
* ❌ No roadmap reset
* ❌ No skipped content

---

## 🧠 Why this split is important

If we jump **directly** from Day-42 → Debugging:

* You’d miss **how factory is *actually* used in production**
* Debugging examples would feel abstract

Day-43 makes Day-44 **make sense**.

## ✅ Final locked roadmap (from here)

| Day | Topic                                                   |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 42  | Factory (Replacement & Scalability) ✅                  |
| 43  | Factory × Config DB (Real-World Patterns)               |
| 44  | Debugging, Failure Modes & Regression Mindset           |
| 45  | Analysis FIFOs, Phase-Aligned Sampling (formal wrap-up) |

(45 is a **consolidation**, not new learning — per your locked roadmap)

If you want, say **“Proceed Day-43”**
I’ll start with **zero theory fluff**, straight to **real industry patterns**.
