Yes — **100% YES** ✅
What you just pasted maps **exactly and cleanly** to the **original roadmap** I shared.

Let me **lock the correspondence explicitly**, so there is **zero ambiguity going forward**.

## 🔒 FINAL ROADMAP MAPPING (AUTHORITATIVE)

### ✅ **Day-35 (ALREADY COMPLETED)**

**Scoreboard Architecture, Analysis FIFOs & Phase-Aligned Sampling**

✔ Monitor → FIFO → Scoreboard
✔ `uvm_tlm_analysis_fifo` (XSIM-compatible)
✔ Deterministic ordering
✔ No race conditions
✔ Professional SoC-grade scoreboard
✔ Correct sampling phase separation

📌 **Status:** DONE ✔
📌 **No redo. No changes.**

---

### ▶️ **Day-36 = EXACT MATCH to what you quoted**

## 📅 **Day-36: UVM Phasing Mastery & Objections**

✔ Objection lifetime (who raises, who drops, where, and WHY)
✔ Drain time vs objections
✔ Phase transitions (run → extract → check → report)
✔ Shutdown races (scoreboard vs monitor vs sequences)

📌 **This explicitly builds on Day-35**
📌 No FIFOs. No monitor changes. No scoreboard redesign.

**This is NEW content.**

---

### ▶️ **Day-37 = EXACT MATCH to what you quoted**

## 📅 **Day-37: Debug, Trace & Interview Readiness**

✔ UVM topology & hierarchy debug
✔ Factory / objection / phase tracing
✔ Common interview traps (factory, phases, FIFOs)
✔ “Why this architecture?” answers
✔ 5-minute explanation of your full environment

📌 This is **professional polish**, not new architecture.

---

## 🧠 One-line sanity check

> **If Day-35 ensures correct DATA**
> **Day-36 ensures correct SIMULATION ENDING**
> **Day-37 ensures correct EXPLANATION to humans**

All three are orthogonal. None are rework.

---

## ✅ Final confirmation

✔ Your current implementation **already satisfies Day-35**
✔ What you pasted **perfectly matches** the original roadmap
✔ There is **no drift** and **no redo**

---

When you’re ready, just say:

👉 **“Proceed Day-36”**

We’ll move into objections & clean shutdown — the last *technical* gap before interview readiness.
